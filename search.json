    "text": "The 2022 St. Louis Cardinals won the NL Central Division and made the playoffs for the fourth straight season. Over the offseason, they didn’t make many changes. They lost key veterans in Cardinal legends Yadier Molina and Albert Pujols. However, those players have their own glaring flaws, and the Cardinals filled their void behind home plate with the top free agent catcher on the market, Willson Contreras.\nDespite the optimism heading into 2023, St. Louis finished dead-last in their weak division. So, where did they go wrong?\nTo analyze their performance last year, we’ll look at all three fazes of the game: hitting, pitching, and defense.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nfielding2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"Fielding2022.csv\")\nfielding2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Fielding2023.csv\")\n\ngoodfielding &lt;- fielding2022 |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nbadfielding &lt;- fielding2023 |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2023) \n\nfielding &lt;- bind_rows(goodfielding, badfielding)\n\nstlfield &lt;- fielding |&gt; filter(Tm == \"St. Louis Cardinals\")\nmilfield &lt;- fielding |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Milwaukee Brewers\")\naveragefield &lt;- fielding |&gt; filter(Tm == \"League Average\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=fielding, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=fielding, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=stlfield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=stlfield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=averagefield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=averagefield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_line(data=milfield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_point(data=milfield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(data=stlfield |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .27, y=`Rdrs/yr`+.1, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text(data=stlfield |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .27, y=`Rdrs/yr`-.1, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\ngeom_text(data=milfield |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .28, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text(data=milfield |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .28, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text(data=averagefield |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .25, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text(data=averagefield |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .25, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2022, 2023), limits=c(2021.5,2023.5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(-4, -2, 0, 2, 4)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", y=\"DRS Above Avg per 1,200 Innings\", title=\"St. Louis plummeted defensively in 2023\", subtitle=\"The Cardinals went from the top of the league to being well-below average.\", caption=\"Source: Baseball-Reference.com | By Bailey Waltke\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of this change could be accredited to defensive specialists Harrison Bader and Paul DeJong garnering less playing time before being traded off. Part could also be accredited to young sluggers Nolan Gorman and Jordan Walker performing rather poorly in the field. Contreras was so bad defensively to begin the season that they temporarily removed him from catching duties. This team may have missed Molina more than they realized.\nGood defense can make a pitching staff look better on paper. The Cardinals were notorious for this for many years, but something seemed off in 2023. So, was the bad defense to blame for such a terrible season?\n\n\nCode\npitching2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"Pitching2022.csv\")\npitching2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Pitching2023.csv\")\n\ngoodpitching &lt;- pitching2022 |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nbadpitching &lt;- pitching2023 |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2023) \n\npitching &lt;- bind_rows(goodpitching, badpitching)\n\naveragepitching &lt;- pitching |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"St. Louis Cardinals\" | Tm == \"Los Angeles Dodgers\" | Tm == \"Atlanta Braves\" | Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\" | Tm == \"San Diego Padres\" | Tm == \"New York Mets\" | Tm == \"Houston Astros\" | Tm == \"New York Yankees\" | Tm == \"Cleveland Guardians\" | Tm == \"Tampa Bay Rays\" | Tm == \"Seattle Mariners\" | Tm == \"Toronto Blue Jays\" | Tm == \"League Average\")\n\naveragepitching |&gt;\n  select(Tm, Season, `HardH%`) |&gt;\n  mutate(`HardH%` = as.numeric(gsub(\"%\",\"\", `HardH%`))) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Season, values_from = `HardH%`) |&gt;\n  arrange(`2023`) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Cardinals pitchers got hit harder in 2023\",\n    subtitle = \"Hard hit rates reveal that St. Louis took a larger step back than any other team who made the playoffs in 2022.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Bailey Waltke  |  **Source:** Baseball-Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#C41E3A\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Tm == \"St. Louis Cardinals\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"black\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Tm == \"League Average\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinals pitchers got hit harder in 2023\n\n\nHard hit rates reveal that St. Louis took a larger step back than any other team who made the playoffs in 2022.\n\n\nTm\n2022\n2023\n\n\n\n\nSan Diego Padres\n38.4\n37.0\n\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n35.6\n37.7\n\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n34.5\n37.9\n\n\nNew York Yankees\n36.5\n38.8\n\n\nAtlanta Braves\n37.2\n38.9\n\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n36.2\n39.0\n\n\nSeattle Mariners\n37.8\n39.4\n\n\nLeague Average\n38.5\n39.5\n\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n39.6\n39.9\n\n\nNew York Mets\n38.1\n40.2\n\n\nCleveland Guardians\n39.8\n40.3\n\n\nHouston Astros\n37.2\n40.4\n\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n38.0\n41.0\n\n\n\nBy: Bailey Waltke | Source: Baseball-Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, isolated from defense, St. Louis pitchers gave up significantly more hard contact than in the year prior. In fact, the Cardinals’ 3% increase in hard contact rate between 2022 and 2023 was the second-worst in baseball over that span.\nSo, the traditional Redbird strategy of pitching to contact didn’t work out, as the pitchers gave up harder contact and the defense wasn’t able to help the pitchers out.\nWell, was the offense okay, at least? Actually, yeah, as a team they were…fine. The standard hitting stats back this up, as St. Louis was just above league average in nearly every metric. However, the Cardinals have two cornerstone position players who are supposed to move the needle: Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado. These two players take up a good chunk of the salary and a lot of at-bats. The batting order revolves around getting on base in front of them.\nPaul Goldschmidt took home the NL MVP Award in 2022, with teammate Nolan Arenado finishing third in the voting. Were they able to replicate that success the following year?\n\n\nCode\narenado &lt;- read_csv(\"Arenado.csv\")\ngoldschmidt &lt;- read_csv(\"Goldschmidt.csv\")\nleagueaverages &lt;- read_csv(\"LeagueAverages.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=arenado, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"#333366\") +\n  geom_point(data=arenado, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"#333366\") +\n  geom_line(data=goldschmidt, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"#A71930\") +\n  geom_point(data=goldschmidt, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"#A71930\") +\n  geom_line(data=leagueaverages, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=leagueaverages, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2023), limits=c(2011, 2023)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0.600, 0.650, 0.700, 0.750, 0.800, 0.850, 0.900, 0.950, 1.000)) +\nlabs(\n  title=\"St. Louis' dynamic duo both regressed offensively in 2023\", \n  subtitle = \"After having MVP-caliber years in 2022, &lt;span style = 'color:#333366;'&gt;Nolan Arenado&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:#A71930;'&gt;Paul Goldschmidt&lt;/span&gt; looked more human and closer to &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;League Average&lt;/span&gt;.

While St. Louis’ average offensive stats suggest that other players were able to step up and take some of the workload off of the two superstars, those players also came with their fair share of ups and downs. This lead to long offensive droughts throughout the season.\nWait, but what about baserunning? Well, the Cardinals sucked there, too. The ’Birds were tied with the sixth-best stolen base percentage in the majors in 2022, as well as tied for fourth-best in extra bases taken percentage. Flipping over to 2023, St. Louis was the seventh-worst team in baseball in each of these respective measures.\nWith the big-ticket free agent signing of Sonny Gray during the 2023-2024 offseason, as well as promotions of glove-first prospects Masyn Winn and Victor Scott II, the Cardinals will be hoping for a much-improved 2024 in comparison to last year."

    "section": "",
    "text": "After trading franchise quarterback Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos following the 2021-2022 NFL season, the Seattle Seahawks were assumed to be starting a rebuild. With journeyman Geno Smith as the best quarterback on the roster entering the new season, many people saw the ’22-’23 season as a lost cause for a potential top draft pick. Across four different teams, the veteran had only started five games in the previous six years combined. The season looked like it was going to be rough.\nSmith then defied expectations of everyone by leading the Seahawks to a 9-8 record and a playoff berth. In a season that saw him win NFL Comeback Player of the Year, he had a completion percentage of nearly 70% and threw 30 touchdown passes. The “rebuild” turned out to be nonexistent, as Seattle went into “win-now” mode by trying to build around their signal-caller.\nThe following offseason, the Seahawks rewarded their quarterback with a three-year, $105 million contract extension. This seems all well and good, unless that was a one-off “fluke” year where players catch fire and find success, only to plummet back down to their norm in the next year. With how shaky Smith’s past performance had been prior to his breakout season, there was warranted skepticism around the league as to locking up the veteran for three years and giving him that much money.\nIn the season that followed, Smith saw his numbers dip, but not very much. His past performance was going to be difficult to repeat, so it shouldn’t be a surprise he didn’t replicate that exact success. The Seahawks went 9-8 on the season, but they missed the playoffs via tiebreaker thanks to the Green Bay Packers.\nThis offseason raised big questions regarding who would be the quarterback moving forward. While Smith still has two years left on his contract, he is already 33 years old. He also saw his production dip in his second year starting for Seattle, and another dip might really handicap the Seahawks’ aspirations to compete for a division title. Perhaps it is time to think about the team’s layout after Smith’s contract expires.\nDuring the offseason, Seattle swung a trade for former Washington Commanders quarterback Sam Howell, who is only 23 and coming off a season where he led the NFL in passing attempts and interceptions. This wasn’t the best showing for Howell, but he’s young and could definitely show improvement over time. However, trading for the young quarterback likely took the Seahawks out of contention for drafting a signal-caller in the upcoming draft. This year’s draft class was loaded with good quarterback prospects, but Seattle (not surprisingly) didn’t end up taking one.\nSo, with a middling plan for the future, is Geno Smith really the franchise quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks? Has he done enough in the past two years to warrant being labeled as “their guy” for the foreseeable future?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\npassing2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"2022passing.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"+\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE))\npassing2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"2023passing.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  mutate(Player = gsub(\"+\", \"\", Player, fixed = TRUE))\n\ntdint2022 &lt;- passing2022 |&gt;\n  select(Player, TD, Int, Att)\n\ntdint2023 &lt;- passing2023 |&gt;\n  select(Player, TD, Int, Att)\n\ntdintratio &lt;- bind_rows(tdint2022, tdint2023) |&gt;\n  group_by(Player) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    totaltds = sum(TD),\n    totalints = sum(Int),\n    totalatts = sum(Att)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  top_n(20, wt=totalatts)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=tdintratio, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, totaltds), x=totaltds, xend=totalints),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Geno Smith's ratio better than most\", \n    subtitle = \"Seattle's signal-caller did a good job throwing &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;touchdowns&lt;/span&gt;, and he was above average when it came to limiting &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;interceptions&lt;/span&gt; when compared to top quarterbacks.\",\n    x=\"Touchdowns vs Interceptions\",\n    y=\"\",\n    caption=\"Source: pro-football-reference.com | By Bailey Waltke\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, there are only two quarterbacks over the past two years with as many touchdowns and fewer interceptions than Geno Smith: Joe Burrow and Jared Goff. So, while he may not be throwing as many touchdowns as someone like Patrick Mahomes or Josh Allen, he’s also being efficient with the football and not passing it to the other team as much.\nCounting stats don’t tell the whole story, however, as some quarterbacks simply throw the ball more than others. Seattle’s new backup Howell had over 100 more passing attempts last season than Smith did. So, how does Geno Smith’s numbers look when averaged, such as completion percentage and yards per attempt?\n\n\nCode\ncomppercent2022 &lt;- passing2022 |&gt;\n  select(Player, QBrec, Cmp, Att, Yds...12)\n\ncomppercent2023 &lt;- passing2023 |&gt;\n  select(Player, QBrec, Cmp, Att, Yds...12)\n\ncomppercent &lt;- bind_rows(comppercent2022, comppercent2023) |&gt;\n  separate(QBrec, into=c(\"Wins\", \"Losses\", \"Ties\"), sep=\"-\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Wins = as.numeric(Wins)) |&gt;\n  group_by(Player) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    totalcompletions = sum(Cmp),\n    totalattempts = sum(Att),\n    totalyards = sum(Yds),\n    totalwins = sum(Wins)\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    CompPercent = (totalcompletions/totalattempts) * 100,\n    YperAtt = totalyards/totalattempts\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(totalattempts &gt; 500)\n\nqbcomppercent &lt;- comppercent |&gt;\nfilter(Player == \"Geno Smith\" | Player == \"Brock Purdy\" | Player == \"Kyler Murray\" | Player == \"Matthew Stafford\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=comppercent, \n    aes(x=CompPercent, y=YperAtt, size=totalwins), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.5) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=qbcomppercent, \n    aes(x=CompPercent, y=YperAtt, size=totalwins), \n    color=\"red\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 64.3) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 7.0) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=qbcomppercent, \n    aes(x=CompPercent, y=YperAtt, label=Player)\n  ) +\n  labs(title=\"Geno Smith among the league's best\", subtitle=\"No. 7 stacks up well in completion percentage and yards per attempt, and he's \\nbetter than two other starters in the NFC West division.\", x=\"Completion Percentage\", y=\"Yards per Attempt\", caption=\"Source: pro-football-reference | By Bailey Waltke\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith grades out well in these metrics, faring better than two of the quarterbacks within his division. While he isn’t necessarily topping these leaderboards, he’s showing overall capability to do what is necessary to lead Seattle’s offense.\nNow, what about regression? As players get older, they often see their production dip as a result. So, how have those older quarterbacks fared as they ventured toward their mid-30s? How does Smith’s numbers stack up?\n\n\nCode\noldqbs23 &lt;- passing2023 |&gt;\n  filter(Player == \"Geno Smith\" | Player == \"Matthew Stafford\" | Player == \"Russell Wilson\" | Player == \"Kirk

quarterbacks to play to their age-35 season have seen their numbers stay consistent, there shouldn’t be much panic about Smith entering the ’24-’25 NFL season. However, this upcoming campaign will be an important one for his future with the organization beyond his current contract.\nIf his numbers stay in line with his production the past two years, then perhaps Seattle has found their guy beyond what he’s already under contract for. If his numbers dip even more from where they were last season, then perhaps a changing of the guard will be set up beyond Smith’s contract."
