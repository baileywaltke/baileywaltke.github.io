    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2022 St. Louis Cardinals won the NL Central Division and made the playoffs for the fourth straight season. Over the offseason, they didn’t make many changes. They lost key veterans in Cardinal legends Yadier Molina and Albert Pujols. However, those players have their own glaring flaws, and the Cardinals filled their void behind home plate with the top free agent catcher on the market, Willson Contreras.\nDespite the optimism heading into 2023, St. Louis finished dead-last in their weak division. So, where did they go wrong?\nTo analyze their performance last year, we’ll look at all three fazes of the game: hitting, pitching, and defense.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nfielding2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"Fielding2022.csv\")\nfielding2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Fielding2023.csv\")\n\ngoodfielding &lt;- fielding2022 |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nbadfielding &lt;- fielding2023 |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2023) \n\nfielding &lt;- bind_rows(goodfielding, badfielding)\n\nstlfield &lt;- fielding |&gt; filter(Tm == \"St. Louis Cardinals\")\nmilfield &lt;- fielding |&gt; filter(Tm == \"Milwaukee Brewers\")\naveragefield &lt;- fielding |&gt; filter(Tm == \"League Average\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_line(data=fielding, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=fielding, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=stlfield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_point(data=stlfield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"red\") +\n  geom_line(data=averagefield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(data=averagefield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"black\") +\n  geom_line(data=milfield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_point(data=milfield, aes(x=Season, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm), color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_text(data=stlfield |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .27, y=`Rdrs/yr`+.1, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text(data=stlfield |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .27, y=`Rdrs/yr`-.1, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\ngeom_text(data=milfield |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .28, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text(data=milfield |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .28, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text(data=averagefield |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season + .25, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  geom_text(data=averagefield |&gt; filter(Season == min(Season)), aes(x=Season - .25, y=`Rdrs/yr`, group=Tm, label=Tm)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2022, 2023), limits=c(2021.5,2023.5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(-4, -2, 0, 2, 4)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", y=\"DRS Above Avg per 1,200 Innings\", title=\"St. Louis plummeted defensively in 2023\", subtitle=\"The Cardinals went from the top of the league to being well-below average.\", caption=\"Source: Baseball-Reference.com | By Bailey Waltke\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of this change could be accredited to defensive specialists Harrison Bader and Paul DeJong garnering less playing time before being traded off. Part could also be accredited to young sluggers Nolan Gorman and Jordan Walker performing rather poorly in the field. Contreras was so bad defensively to begin the season that they temporarily removed him from catching duties. This team may have missed Molina more than they realized.\nGood defense can make a pitching staff look better on paper. The Cardinals were notorious for this for many years, but something seemed off in 2023. So, was the bad defense to blame for such a terrible season?\n\n\nCode\npitching2022 &lt;- read_csv(\"Pitching2022.csv\")\npitching2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Pitching2023.csv\")\n\ngoodpitching &lt;- pitching2022 |&gt; \n  mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nbadpitching &lt;- pitching2023 |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2023) \n\npitching &lt;- bind_rows(goodpitching, badpitching)\n\naveragepitching &lt;- pitching |&gt;\n  filter(Tm == \"St. Louis Cardinals\" | Tm == \"Los Angeles Dodgers\" | Tm == \"Atlanta Braves\" | Tm == \"Philadelphia Phillies\" | Tm == \"San Diego Padres\" | Tm == \"New York Mets\" | Tm == \"Houston Astros\" | Tm == \"New York Yankees\" | Tm == \"Cleveland Guardians\" | Tm == \"Tampa Bay Rays\" | Tm == \"Seattle Mariners\" | Tm == \"Toronto Blue Jays\" | Tm == \"League Average\")\n\naveragepitching |&gt;\n  select(Tm, Season, `HardH%`) |&gt;\n  mutate(`HardH%` = as.numeric(gsub(\"%\",\"\", `HardH%`))) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(names_from = Season, values_from = `HardH%`) |&gt;\n  arrange(`2023`) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Cardinals pitchers got hit harder in 2023\",\n    subtitle = \"Hard hit rates reveal that St. Louis took a larger step back than any other team who made the playoffs in 2022.\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Bailey Waltke  |  **Source:** Baseball-Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#C41E3A\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Tm == \"St. Louis Cardinals\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"black\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Tm == \"League Average\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinals pitchers got hit harder in 2023\n\n\nHard hit rates reveal that St. Louis took a larger step back than any other team who made the playoffs in 2022.\n\n\nTm\n2022\n2023\n\n\n\n\nSan Diego Padres\n38.4\n37.0\n\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies\n35.6\n37.7\n\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers\n34.5\n37.9\n\n\nNew York Yankees\n36.5\n38.8\n\n\nAtlanta Braves\n37.2\n38.9\n\n\nTampa Bay Rays\n36.2\n39.0\n\n\nSeattle Mariners\n37.8\n39.4\n\n\nLeague Average\n38.5\n39.5\n\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n39.6\n39.9\n\n\nNew York Mets\n38.1\n40.2\n\n\nCleveland Guardians\n39.8\n40.3\n\n\nHouston Astros\n37.2\n40.4\n\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals\n38.0\n41.0\n\n\n\nBy: Bailey Waltke | Source: Baseball-Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, isolated from defense, St. Louis pitchers gave up significantly more hard contact than in the year prior. In fact, the Cardinals’ 3% increase in hard contact rate between 2022 and 2023 was the second-worst in baseball over that span.\nSo, the traditional Redbird strategy of pitching to contact didn’t work out, as the pitchers gave up harder contact and the defense wasn’t able to help the pitchers out.\nWell, was the offense okay, at least? Actually, yeah, as a team they were…fine. The standard hitting stats back this up, as St. Louis was just above league average in nearly every metric. However, the Cardinals have two cornerstone position players who are supposed to move the needle: Paul Goldschmidt and Nolan Arenado. These two players take up a good chunk of the salary and a lot of at-bats. The batting order revolves around getting on base in front of them.\nPaul Goldschmidt took home the NL MVP Award in 2022, with teammate Nolan Arenado finishing third in the voting. Were they able to replicate that success the following year?\n\n\nCode\narenado &lt;- read_csv(\"Arenado.csv\")\ngoldschmidt &lt;- read_csv(\"Goldschmidt.csv\")\nleagueaverages &lt;- read_csv(\"LeagueAverages.csv\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=arenado, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"#333366\") +\n  geom_point(data=arenado, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"#333366\") +\n  geom_line(data=goldschmidt, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"#A71930\") +\n  geom_point(data=goldschmidt, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"#A71930\") +\n  geom_line(data=leagueaverages, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_point(data=leagueaverages, aes(x=Year, y=OPS), color=\"blue\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021, 2023), limits=c(2011, 2023)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0.600, 0.650, 0.700, 0.750, 0.800, 0.850, 0.900, 0.950, 1.000)) +\nlabs(\n  title=\"St. Louis' dynamic duo both regressed offensively in 2023\", \n  subtitle = \"After having MVP-caliber years in 2022, &lt;span style = 'color:#333366;'&gt;Nolan Arenado&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style = 'color:#A71930;'&gt;Paul Goldschmidt&lt;/span&gt; looked more human and closer to &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;League Average&lt;/span&gt;. This resulted in the corner infielders having one of the worst hitting seasons in each of their respective careers.\", \n  caption=\"Source: Baseball-Reference.com | By Bailey Waltke\"\n) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(\n  plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n  axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n  plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(size=10),\n  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n  plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldschmidt and Arenado were mere mortals in 2023, so the offense was shaky at times when they couldn’t rely on those two to bring the thunder. While St. Louis’ average offensive stats suggest that other players were able to step up and take some of the workload off of the two superstars, those players also came with their fair share of ups and downs. This lead to long offensive droughts throughout the season.\nWait, but what about baserunning? Well, the Cardinals sucked there, too. The ’Birds were tied with the sixth-best stolen base percentage in the majors in 2022, as well as tied for fourth-best in extra bases taken percentage. Flipping over to 2023, St. Louis was the seventh-worst team in baseball in each of these respective measures.\nWith the big-ticket free agent signing of Sonny Gray during the 2023-2024 offseason, as well as promotions of glove-first prospects Masyn Winn and Victor Scott II, the Cardinals will be hoping for a much-improved 2024 in comparison to last year."
